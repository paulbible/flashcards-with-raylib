What is the process of breaking a tuple into its individual parts called?,Destructuring.
How can you access an individual element of a tuple directly without destructuring?,"You can use a period `.` followed by the zero-based index of the element (e.g., `my_tuple.0`)."
"What is the name for a tuple with no values, written as `()`?",It is called the unit type or unit tuple.
What is the primary constraint for all elements within a Rust array?,Every element of an array must have the same type.
What is the syntax for declaring an array in Rust that specifies both the element type and the number of elements?,"`let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];` where `i32` is the type and `5` is the length."
How can you initialize an array in Rust to contain the same value for every element?,"By specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, then the length (e.g., `let a = [3; 5];`)."
How do you access elements in a Rust array?,"Using square bracket notation with a zero-based index (e.g., `my_array[0]`)."
What happens at runtime if you attempt to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds?,The program will panic and exit with an error.
"What is a vector in Rust, and how does it differ from an array?","A vector is a resizable collection type, unlike arrays which have a fixed size."
"What is one way to create a new, empty vector?","Using `Vec::new()`, which requires a type annotation (e.g., `let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();`)."
The _____ macro provides a convenient way to create a new vector with initial values.,"`vec!` (e.g., `let v = vec![1, 2, 3];`)"
Which method is used to add a new element to the end of a vector?,The `push()` method.
"What does the `get()` method for vectors return, providing a way to access elements without risking a panic?","It returns an `Option<T>`, which will be `Some(&element)` if the index is valid or `None` if it is out of bounds."
What does the `pop()` method do on a vector?,It removes the last element from the vector and returns it wrapped in an `Option`.
"In Rust, are parentheses required around the condition in an `if` statement?","No, parentheses are not required around the condition."
The condition for an `if` expression in Rust must evaluate to a value of type _____.,`bool`
What are the three kinds of loops available in Rust?,"`loop`, `while`, and `for`."
Which Rust loop construct creates an infinite loop that runs until you explicitly tell it to stop?,The `loop` keyword.
How do you break out of a `loop` in Rust?,Using the `break` keyword.
How does a `for` loop in Rust typically iterate over a collection like an array?,"It iterates through each element in the collection (e.g., `for element in a`)."
"When using a `for` loop with a range, such as `for number in 0..10`, which numbers are included in the iteration?","The numbers from 0 up to, but not including, 10 (i.e., 0 through 9)."
What keyword is used to define a function in Rust?,The `fn` keyword.
"In a Rust function signature, is it mandatory to declare the type of each parameter?","Yes, you must declare the type of each function parameter."
What is the syntax used in a function signature to declare the return type?,"An arrow `->` followed by the type (e.g., `fn my_func() -> i32`)."
What is the primary difference between a statement and an expression in Rust?,"Statements are instructions that perform an action but do not return a value, while expressions evaluate to a resultant value."
How can a function in Rust return a value without using the `return` keyword?,The value of the final expression in the function body is automatically returned.
What happens to the return value of a function if a semicolon is added to the final expression?,"It becomes a statement, and the function will implicitly return the unit type `()`."
What is the purpose of an `enum` in Rust?,An enum (enumeration) allows you to define a type by listing its possible variants.
"In the context of a Rust `enum`, each of the possible values listed in the definition is called a _____.",variant
Can enum variants in Rust hold associated data?,"Yes, variants can have associated data of different types and amounts (e.g., `enum Message { Write(String), };`)."
The `match` control flow operator allows you to compare a value against a series of _____.,patterns
What does it mean for `match` arms in Rust to be exhaustive?,It means you must cover every single possible value of the type being matched.
What pattern can be used as the last arm in a `match` expression to catch any value not specified in the preceding arms?,"The wildcard pattern, which is a single underscore `_`."
What concept in other languages is the `Option` enum in Rust designed to handle safely?,It is designed to handle null or nonexistent values.
What are the two variants of the `Option<T>` enum?,"`Some(T)`, which holds a value of type `T`, and `None`, which signifies no value."
"What is the purpose of the `Result<T, E>` enum in Rust?","It is used for error handling, representing either a success (`Ok`) or a failure (`Err`)."
"What are the two variants of the `Result<T, E>` enum?","`Ok(T)`, which contains a success value of type `T`, and `Err(E)`, which contains an error value of type `E`."
What will happen if you call the `.unwrap()` method on an `Option` that has the value `None`?,The program will panic.
What will happen if you call the `.unwrap()` method on a `Result` that has an `Err` value?,The program will panic.
What boolean-returning method can you call on an `Option` to check if it contains a value?,The `is_some()` method.
What boolean-returning method can you call on a `Result` to check if it represents a successful operation?,The `is_ok()` method.
How does `unwrap_or()` differ from `unwrap()` for an `Option` or `Result`?,"`unwrap_or()` returns the contained value if it exists, otherwise it returns a default value that you provide instead of panicking."
What is the result of using the `or` operator (`|`) within a `match` arm pattern?,"It allows a single block of code to run for multiple patterns (e.g., `Some(3) | Some(4) => ...`)."
